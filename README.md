# PageRank Algorithm

### Motivation

People search the web every day, expecting to find results that are most relevant to their search criterion. Google has become the dominant search engine because of the accuracy of its ranking algorithm. Without it, users would be left digging through page after page, trying to find relevant information. The PageRank algorithm essentially automates this process. Larry Page and Sergey Brin first developed the algorithm at Stanford University in 1996. It was based off the idea that information on the web should be ordered by popularity; pages with more links to them should rank higher than those with fewer links.
